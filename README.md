# FileCopy base on OFP

[OFP (OpenFastPath)](http://www.openfastpath.org) is an open source implementation of a high performance TCP/IP stack that provides features that network application developers need to cope with todayâ€™s fast-paced network.  

This is a client/server file transfer program base on OFP/ODP.  

for server:
```
$ ./ofpcp -i 0 -c 4 -l -N [-a] [-w /data]   
-l [IP_ADDRESS]:  
	mean listen on any port if have no ip_address following it.  

-a:    
	ask server to auto create the non-exist dir path if client have the dir path.   

-w WORK_DIR:    
	ask server change the working dir to specific location.   

-S:   
	pseudo mode. in pseudo mode, there is no data writing in local files.   

-N:   
	notify mode.    

-I STATISTICS_SECONDS:   
	server start statistic in file ofpcp.stat   
```
	

for client:   
```
$ ./ofpcp -i 0 -c 10 -s 192.168.100.33 [-p 12345] [-P 4] [-b 8] -d ../*.data   
-s IP_ADDRESS:   
	specify the server address to connect   

-p PORT:   
	if ommited, use default port   

-d FILES:    
	FILES can use wildcard and with path, be careful the path will be created in the server side if it has -a argument.   

-b SPLIT_BLOCK_K:    
	specify the split block size in KB, default is 16, if specify 0, it mean send files without split.   

-C    
	enter to interactive command mode   

-B    
	send file with burst mode, means use multi thread concurrently.   

-P POOL_COUNT:    
	set to pool pthread mode, each thread has a pre-connection to server.   

-S:   
	pseudo mode. in pseudo mode, there is no data read from local files.   

-k PINGPONG_COUNT:   
	set the pingpong count, test the latency between server.   

-A AGENT_COUNT:   
	set the dedicated agent thread count, other threads send packets through these threads.
